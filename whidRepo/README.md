# whidRepo

Collection of Payloads from my work on the Hak5 Rubber Duckies and the WHID Injectors.

The collection is the following:

## Rubber Ducky scripts

### Sexy Gandalf Revisions

This will execute the Sexy Gandalf 10 Hour loop video (See [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtUl0SXOqbM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtUl0SXOqbM)) on the selected system. The following is what we have included, names are related to what system we have tested the scripts on and can verify the scripts work on those systems;

- Chrome Windows 10-x64
- Default Browser Windows 10-x64
- Firefox Ubuntu Unity 16.04
- Firefox Xubuntu XFCE 16.04
  
### memeware-downloader

This will download a executable from a website of your choice, and execute the executable on the system, in this case, we used the memeware program, which source is located in the payloads folder under `advandedMemeware.cs`. This was a variation of the downloader from the duck toolkit's payload generator, to be a lot less shit. It was tested on a Windows 10 box and a Windows 7 box, both x64 bit, with local admin account.
REMEMBER TO APPEND THE WORD `URL` IN THE SCRIPT BEFORE UPLOADING.

Detection: The executable will be left in the following directory with the following filename `C:\Users\Public\43461.exe`

## WHID Injector scripts

All the following were not hand coded, but generated using a JS based converter called [Dckuino.js](https://seytonic.com/ducky/)

There are variations of the previous Sexy Gandalf revision for Ubuntu using Unity, but with variations of the videos played.
